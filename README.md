# My First Webpage: Prework Study Guide

## Description

Before starting the coding bootcamp, I knew I had to complete the prework to get off to a strong start. During this prework project I built a study guide website with the coding techniques I learned through the prework guide. It taught me many of the basics that will lay the foundation of what I'm about to learn over the next 3 months.

This study guide will help guide me to a resource that will show me things I've already learned as I am sure I will have to come back to for reference throughout the course.
